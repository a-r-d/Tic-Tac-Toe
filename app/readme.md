Running the Game
================

To run this project install the 'flask' module ("pip install flask" if you have pip, 
if you don't have pip you should be able to get it with "easy_install pip") 
then inside of the "app" folder run the "app.py" file on the command line. 

Go to http://localhost:5000 and have fun!

Notes

To Develop this project I used:

* python 2.7.2
* flask 0.10.1
